### Description

Targeting programmers or anyone who are interested in programming, **Coder Community** is a social network for programmers to connect with each other, share ideas, write articles.

- It will store user information, Social network (friends/followers), Blogs and associated items (comments, likes, images), video diary items (short videos, images, voice clips).
- Users will be able to:
  - Feel a sense of belonging
  - Self improvement (learning and staying up to date with latest technology)
  - Find friends and project partners
- Additionally, we hope to implement, based on time constraints:
  Real-time messaging, integration with other services such as automatic uploading to Youtube

### Project task requirements:

#### 3-5 minimal requirements (will definitely complete)

- Login and authentication system
- Allows users to upload videos, photos, pics, and create, delete, update posts
- Allows users to comment on other usersâ€™ blogs
- Implements server following RESTful principles with basic functions (including GET PUT POST DELETE) being supported.
- Connects to MongoDB and be able to store and retrieve user comments when requested.

#### 3-7 "standard" requirements (will most likely complete)

- Show posts in categories (tags) and popularity
- Create groups which people can join

- Supports user authentication using passport or other packages
- Deploys using heroku or other cloud services

#### 2-3 stretch requirements (plan to complete 1!)

- Allow user to upload interactive coding tutorial
- Real-time messaging (one-on-one and group chat)

### Pick 2 of your minimal requirements and break each of them down into ~2-5 smaller tasks!

#### (1) Create/edit/delete articles

- Create MongoDB schema for articles
- Write back end API service in NodeJS
- Create Web interface for creation/editing/deletion/viewing articles
- Integrate with login / authentication system

#### (2) Login and authentication system
